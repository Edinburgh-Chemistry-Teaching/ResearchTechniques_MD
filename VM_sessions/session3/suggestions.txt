For task 2: we want them to make a box thats ~3x3 nm right (for a 1.2 nm cutoff)? I think it would be better to specify that in the title instead of "create a single clay sheet from 24 MMT UCs" cause they might make -nbox 24 24 1 which would be way too big
Suggestion: title of task 2 -> Use genconf to create a single clay sheet from MMT UCs with a cutoff of 1.2 nm

Task 6: the EM troubleshooting part might confuse some as we haven't got to that stage in this set-up yet
Suggestion: move to the bottom of the EM section (task 9) and rephrase to make references make sense again
