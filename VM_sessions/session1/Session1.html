    <h2 id="overview">Session Outline</h2>
    <p>This session is based upon <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/"><strong>The Unix Shell</strong></a>,
        the <a href="https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/"><strong>Introduction to Using the Shell in a High-Performance Computing Context</strong></a>
        and <a href="https://epcced.github.io/hpc-intro/"><strong>Introduction to High-Performance Computing</strong></a> courses.</p>

    <p>
        The material is divided into 7 parts, and for the purpose of this course you are only required to do <strong>Part 1, Part 2</strong> and
        <strong>Part 7</strong>. The other parts are beneficial, especially if you are planning to use these skills beyond this course, but are not
        essential for the following sessions.</p>

    <ol>
        <li> <a href="Intro2BASH_S1.html"><strong>Navigating Files and Directories</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="Intro2BASH_S2.html"><strong>Working With Files and Directories</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="Intro2BASH_S3.html"><strong>Pipes and Filters</strong></a> (Advanced) </li>

    </ol>

    <p>
        Each part contains instructions that you should follow during the session, and additional <strong>Questions</strong> and <strong>Tasks
    </strong> at the end of each section that should be done after the session (or during <em>only</em> if you have finished all required parts).
        All the questions and tasks have answers/solutions provided in a drop-down.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">Overview</h2>
    <p>In computing, a <strong>shell</strong> is a computer programme that allows you to communicate with Unix operating systems (Linux and
        MacOS). We do this using a <strong>command-line interface</strong> where we input lines of text that instruct the shell on what to do. The
        most popular Unix shell is Bash (Bourne Again SHell), which is the default on most modern unix systems. This is what we will be using to
        perform our tasks, via the <strong>Terminal</strong> application.</p>

    <p>Typically, we use <strong>graphical interfaces</strong> to use a computer (clicking a mouse and using menus). However, some tasks can take
        hours to do using this method, whereas using a command line could take only seconds. Additionally, we can <strong>create scripts to automate
            tasks</strong>, meaning we can do other things while the shell is working.</p>

    <p>The Unix shell is a powerful tool, with a <strong>high action-to-keystroke ratio</strong>, making complex and powerful tasks easier. It is
        <strong>essential for accessing</strong> (and managing) networked machines and <strong>high-performance computers</strong>.</p>

    <p>Using the shell can seem daunting at the beginning, but <strong>only a few "words" (commands)</strong> are needed to perform a wide
        variety of tasks. Unlike when normally using a computer, there are no choices automatically presented and so it is necessary to <strong>learn
            some essential commands</strong>. As with most computing problems, <strong>using the programme documentation</strong> or a <strong>simple
            Google search</strong> can usually tell you what command and options are needed to do whatever you require.</p>

    <p>A summary of some basic Bash commands used during this session can be found <a
            href="bash_cheat_sheet.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="problem">A Typical Problem</h3>
    <p>Iris Spectra, a chemistry student, has been doing a research project involving IR spectroscopy. They have performed 100 synthesis experiments
        and collected the spectra as individual text files. Each file needs processed to normalise the data, get the peak positions and assign the
        peaks to functional groups. They also want to generate a summary of the 100 experiments to present to their supervisor. In addition to this
        huge task, the results need written up in 2 weeks so that the paper can appear in a special additional of <em>The Journal of Immaterial
            Science</em>.</p>

    <p>To speed up the process, Iris has created a programme called <code>IR_spectra.sh</code> to perform the analysis, but if it was run by hand
        using a graphical interface they will have to select and open all 100 files. If <code>IR_spectra.sh</code> takes 2 minutes to run, the whole
        process will over 3 hours. Using the shell, Iris can instead assign the task to their computer while focussing on writing the paper.</p>

    <p>In this session will explore the ways Iris can achieve this. More specifically, the practical explains how they can use a command shell to run the
    <code>IR_spectra.sh</code> program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that Iris&rsquo; computer can work
    while they write the paper.</p>

    <p>As a bonus, once Iris has put a processing pipeline together, they will be able to use it again whenever they collect more data.</p>

    <p>In order to achieve the task, Iris needs to know how to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to a file/directory</li>
        <li>Create a file/directory</li>
        <li>Chain commands together</li>
        <li>Retrieve a set of files</li>
        <li>Iterate over files</li>
        <li>Run a shell script containing the pipeline</li>
    </ul>
