section: Methods
subsection: Simulation system
A system of 9241 molecules (29383 atoms) was simulated.

subsection: Simulation settings
A total of 0.05 ns were simulated with a time step of 1 fs.
Neighbor searching was performed every 10 steps.
The PME algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions.
with a cut-off of 1.2 nm.
A reciprocal grid of 64 x 64 x 64 cells was used with 4th order B-spline interpolation.
A single cut-off of 1.2 nm was used for Van der Waals interactions.
Temperature coupling was done with the V-rescale algorithm.
Pressure coupling was done with the C-rescale algorithm.
