# Report guidelines (max. 1000 words):

# MD simulation of interaction of oil and smectite clay
## Overview (max. 100 words):
Briefly describe the problem. What did you investigate, which approach did you use and what were the key findings and 
observations?

## Methodology (max. 500 words):
Describe all key steps in a condensed form.
This section should include the minimal necessary information for someone who reads it to be able to reproduce your results.
Include the following:
- System setup (e.g. where did you get the structure(s) from, how did you manipulate them to obtain the model you used in 
 the simulation, which forcefield(s) did you use, what was your system size, etc.)
- Simulation protocol: include all relevant run information (e.g. run type algorithm, time step, temperature, pressure, 
 simulation length, etc.) for your energy minimisation, equilibration and production runs.
- Analysis: How did you make sure your system was equilibrated within the time frame that you analysed? 
- What analysis did you perform on your trajectories? 
 Include all relevant information about the analysis you performed on your trajectories, including the software you used, (e.g. which tools did you use, which parameters did you use, how did you prepare the plot of your analysis data, how did you produce the rendering of 
 your system, etc.)

## Results (max. 400 words including figure captions):
Describe your result data with a plot that illustrates your findings and a rendering of the system. 
Make sure to add all the descriptive captions that are necessary for understanding the figures without the need
to refer to the text.

## References:
Include consistently formatted references for relevant literature, structures, force field parameters and software 
packages used in your project.
