    <p>This session is based upon <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/"><strong>The Unix Shell</strong></a>,
        the <a href="https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/"><strong>Introduction to Using the Shell in a High-Performance Computing Context</strong></a>
        and <a href="https://epcced.github.io/hpc-intro/"><strong>Introduction to High-Performance Computing</strong></a> courses.</p>

    <p> The material is divided into 7 parts, and for the purpose of this course you are only required to do <strong>Parts 1 to 3</strong>. The
        other parts are beneficial, especially if you are planning to use these skills beyond this course, but are not essential for the following
        sessions.</p>

    <p>Essential Topics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="margin-top:-4mm"> <a href="part1.html"><strong>Navigating Files and Directories</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="part2.html"><strong>Working With Files and Directories</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="part3.html"><strong>Using High-Performance Computers</strong></a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Advanced Topics:</p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li style="margin-top:-4mm"> <a href="part4.html"><strong>Pipes and Filters</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="part5.html"><strong>Loops</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="part6.html"><strong>Shell Scripts</strong></a> </li>
        <li> <a href="part7.html"><strong>Finding Things</strong></a> </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Each part contains instructions that you should follow during the session, and additional <strong>Questions</strong> and <strong>Tasks
    </strong> at the end of each section that should be done after the session (or during <em>only</em> if you have finished all required parts).
        All the questions and tasks have answers/solutions provided in a drop-down.</p>

    <p>A BASH cheatsheet of the key commands you will learn can be found <a href="bash_cheat_sheet_short.html">here</a> and on LEARN. A more
        detailed cheatsheet can be found <a href="bash_cheat_sheet.html">here</a>.

    <h2 id="toc_3">Overview</h2>
    <p>In computing, a <strong>shell</strong> is a computer programme that allows you to communicate with Unix operating systems (Linux and
        MacOS). We do this using a <strong>command-line interface</strong> where we input lines of text that instruct the shell on what to do. The
        most popular Unix shell is Bash (Bourne Again SHell), which is the default on most modern unix systems. This is what we will be using to
        perform our tasks, via the <strong>Terminal</strong> application.</p>

    <p>Typically, we use <strong>graphical interfaces</strong> to use a computer (clicking a mouse and using menus). However, some tasks can take
        hours to do using this method, whereas using a command line could take only seconds. Additionally, we can <strong>create scripts to automate
            tasks</strong>, meaning we can do other things while the shell is working.</p>

    <p>The Unix shell is a powerful tool, with a <strong>high action-to-keystroke ratio</strong>, making complex and powerful tasks easier. It is
        <strong>essential for accessing</strong> (and managing) networked machines and <strong>high-performance computers</strong>.</p>

    <p>Using the shell can seem daunting at the beginning, but <strong>only a few "words" (commands)</strong> are needed to perform a wide
        variety of tasks. Unlike when normally using a computer, there are no choices automatically presented and so it is necessary to <strong>learn
            some essential commands</strong>. As with most computing problems, <strong>using the programme documentation</strong> or a <strong>simple
            Google search</strong> can usually tell you what command and options are needed to do whatever you require.</p>

    <h3 id="toc_4">A Typical Problem</h3>

    <p>Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific Gyre</a>, where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>. She has 1520 samples that she’s run
        through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program
        called <code>goostats.sh</code>. In addition to this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month, so her paper can appear
        in a special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.</p>

    <p>If Nelle chooses to run <code>goostats.sh</code> by hand using a graphical interface, she’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If
        <code>goostats.sh</code> takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle’s attention. With the
        shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses her attention on writing her paper.</p>

    <p>In this session will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this. More specifically, the practical explains how she can use a command shell to run
        the <code>goostats.sh</code> program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that Nelle's computer can work
        while she writes her paper.</p>

    <p>As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.</p>

    <p>In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to a file/directory</li>
        <li>Create a file/directory</li>
        <li>Chain commands together</li>
        <li>Retrieve a set of files</li>
        <li>Iterate over files</li>
        <li>Run a shell script containing the pipeline</li>
    </ul>
