    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Computational techniques have become an integral part of the research, with their importance and
        contribution to scientific discovery growing rapidly in recent years. The use of computational
        techniques in chemistry has made it possible to simulate chemical reactions and predict the properties
        of molecules with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

    <p>Additionally, molecular simulations have made it possible to study complex systems that are difficult,
        if not impossible, to study experimentally, such as large protein complexes, biological membranes,
        interactions of molecules and materials at the interface, and processes in space or in extreme conditions.
        These methods have had a positive impact on society by accelerating the development of new drugs, materials,
        and technologies.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is essential for students to have a solid understanding of computational techniques and their
        applications in modern scientific methods. This part of the course focuses on molecular dynamics simulations,
        one of the most commonly used methodologies in current research. </p>

    <h2 id="toc_4">Course Organisation</h2>
    <p>The sessions are 3 hours long, and students are expected to carry out work independently <u>after</u> each session. </p>
    <p><strong>Drop-in sessions</strong> with demonstrators are scheduled weekly. You do not
        need to have any specific questions; you are welcome to just come over and work, knowing that a demonstrator
        will be there to help if needed. </p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2 id="toc_5">Assessment</h2>
    <p> You will be assessed on your comprehension of the material via two online multiple choice quizzes based on Sessions 1 and 2.
        <strong>Only one attempt is allowed per student per quiz</strong>, and <strong>you must complete the quiz in one sitting</strong>. There
        will be short non-assessed quizzes to test your understanding of the key concepts, which must be passed before the assessed quizzes can be
        taken. These can be attempted multiple times, to help get you used to the system. </p>

    <p> You will also submit an individual project (started during Session 4) in the form of a short, written report. The templates for
        the report are provided in sessions 3 and 4.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_6">Use of AI tools</h2>
    <p>AI tools can be of great help in many aspects of life, including learning. <strong>However</strong>, there are
        limitations to their applicability. This course is made to teach you how to use tools in computational
        chemistry; it is not developed around the use of AI technologies. Therefore, the use of Generative AI during
        learning exercises may limit the uptake of relevant knowledge and hinder the development of necessary skills.</p>

    <p>We also want to bring to your attention information on <strong>the use of Generative AI in the assessments</strong>. The assessments are
        expected to contain your original work. All summative submissions will be checked for the presence of AI-generated
        text and code. Cases of misconduct can be dealt with at School or College level depending on seriousness, and penalties may apply. You can
        find more information about University of Edinburgh Academic Misconduct Procedures <a
                href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/academicmisconductprocedures.pdf">here</a>. Further guidance on academic
        misconduct (including plagiarism) and how to avoid it can be found <a
                href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/staff/discipline/academic-misconduct">here</a>.

        Therefore, ensure your work does not flag as misconduct, when AI tools are used to assist you during the
        assessment preparation, you MUST DECLARE it by stating:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> What tool has been used (e.g., University-licenced ELM or ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI)</li>
        <li> What was the exact prompt</li>
        <li> Link to the output (&lsquo;link to chat&rsquo; for ChatGpT or a compilation of outputs as an appendix)</li>
        <li> What modifications have been done to the generated output before it was incorporated into the submitted work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We recommend using the University-licenced <a href="https://elm.edina.ac.uk/elm/elm">ELM</a> since it does not share your data.</p>
