For the last part of the Computational Research Techniques, you are tasked to carry out individual projects.

Everyone will have a slightly different project, in its execution similar to the one from Session 3. The projects will be allocated and discussed during Session 4 on Friday 9th of February.

You will carry out your project independently over Week 5, **submitting the report on Friday 16th of February**.

The project report is in the form of a short PDF (see templates provided), describing your project, methodology, and observations and featuring a rendering of your system and a figure plotting the analyzed quantity. 



># Guidance for the Report
>
> [Marked out of total 30 pts] 
>
> **Title** -- descriptive, direct, concise, and should not be misleading.
> 
> **Overview**  (max. 100 words):
> 
> [5 pts]
> 
> Briefly describe the problem. What did you investigate, which approach did you use and what were the key findings and observations? 
> 
> **Methodology**  (max. 500 words):
> 
> [12 pts]
> 
> Describe all key steps in a condensed form. This section should include the minimal necessary information for someone who reads it to be able to reproduce your results.
> 
> As a guidance, include the following:
> 
> * **System setup**. Consider the following questions:
> 	* where did you get the structure(s) from?
> 	* how did you manipulate them to obtain the model you used in the simulation?
> 	* which forcefield(s) did you use? 
> 	* what was your system size?
> * **Simulation protocol**. Include all relevant run information for your energy minimization, equilibration, and production runs, e.g.:
> 	* run type algorithm (energy minimization or molecular dynamic?)
> 	* time step
> 	* simulation length
> 	* temperature control (thermostat)
> 	* pressure control (barrostat)
> * **Analysis**. Consider the following questions when writing this section:
> 	* how did you make sure your system was equilibrated within the time frame that you analyzed?
> 	* what analysis did you perform on your trajectories?
> 	* what part of the trajectory did you use? Any timeframes skipped?
> 	* include all relevant information about the analysis you performed on your trajectories, software (e.g., GROMACS, VMD), and tools within those you used (e.g., gms density, gms rms, etc.); which parameters did you use when running these analysis tools.
> 	* how did you prepare the plot of your analysis data?
> 	* how did you produce the rendering of your system?
> 
> 
> **Results** (max. 400 words, incl. figure captions):
> 
> [Total 13 pts, incl. 5 pts for figures, 3 pts for captions]
> 
> Describe your result data with a plot that illustrates your findings and a rendering of the system, highlighting a key interaction or alignment. Make sure to add all the descriptive captions that are necessary for understanding the figures without the need to refer to the text.
> 
> **References** (not included in word count):
> 
> Include consistently formatted references for relevant literature, structures, forcefield parameters, and software packages used in your project.



# Project Report Templates


The project should be submitted as a PDF file. We encourage you to use one of the following two templates to guide you through report preparation. 

* Word .doc template
[Template_PgT_ResearchTechniques_CompChem.dotx](./Template_PgT_ResearchTechniques_CompChem.dotx)

* OverLeaf LaTex template (we will discuss how to use OverLeaf during session 4)

## Using OverLeaf Template:


1. Register with your University email at [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)
2. Click on the link to the [OverLeaf Template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bypxzfbvhnxw#eaf10b); you will be prompted to 'Join the Project', click yes, and it will open in your browser.
3. This is a template and is not editable. 
4. To make an editable copy, click on the 'Menu' (top left) ![](../../Overleaf_howto_1.png)
4. Select 'Copy Project' and give it a name, click 'Copy' ![](../../Overleaf_howto_2.png)
5. The project will now appear in your project list ![](../../Overleaf_howto_3.png)
6. Click on the project to open it. You can now edit the text. Make sure to click compile to see the changes appear on the PDF ![](../../Overleaf_howto_4.png)
7. When you are ready to submit, you can download a PDF (make sure to do a final recompile!) ![](../../Overleaf_howto_5.png)
