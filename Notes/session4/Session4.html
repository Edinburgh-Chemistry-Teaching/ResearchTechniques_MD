    <h2>Computational Project</h2>
    <p> Session 4 is the final session of the course. In this session, your modelling project will be discussed and allocated.
        This will give you the opportunity to apply the skills you have acquired during the previous sessions to
        real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p> You will select your project depending on your cohort, with one student per project. <strong>You must carry out your project work
        independently. </strong>
    </p>
    <p> Everyone will have a slightly different project but the execution of the project is similar to the study you did during Session 3. The
        projects will be allocated and discussed during Session 4. You will then have two weeks to complete these projects. To support you in this
        work we hold drop-in sessions in each of the weeks. You are welcome to attend any and as many of drop-in sessions as you feel is necessary
        for you.

    <h2 class="enum" id="toc_2"> Writing your report </h2>

    <p> Your final project work will be evaluated based on the report that you hand in. The project report is submitted in the form of a PDF.
        <strong>The deadline for submission is 23:59 Monday 17th February.</strong> The project report will describe your project, methodology, and
        observations, it should feature rendering of your system and plot the analyzed quantities. The report is should include the following
        sections: Abstract, Overview, Methods, Results and Discussions, Conclusions, and References. The details of each section are discussed
        during the session and are included in the templates provided.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="Project_TEMPLATE.docx">Microsoft Word template</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/vhpwvtgwygbx#cb9c81">OverLeaf LaTex template</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p> Overall, your report should be about 1500 words and include a description of your work and motivation, a figure of the system, an analysis
        plot and possibly a table. You should comment on why certain parameters/settings/analysis was done. We will grade the project based on the
        clarity of the report and the quality of simulations, analysis and interpretation. We are particularly looking for careful detailing of the
        methods and quality of simulations with reasoning for the choices of methods for set-up and analysis. Reports with well-thought-out
        illustrative figures and tables summarising and highlighting your results, accompanied by descriptive captions will be awarded higher grades.
    </p>
    <p> Detailed guidance is available on Learn, along with more information on using LaTeX and Overleaf. We are also providing you with an example
        project report. The report is based on the simulation of decanoic acid on MMT clay, similar to the one done in Session 3 for the Materials
        and Analytical Chemistry groups.

    <h3>Use of AI</h3>
    <p>AI tools can be of great help in many aspects of life, including learning. <strong>However</strong>, there are
        limitations to their applicability. This course is made to teach you how to use tools in computational
        chemistry; it is not developed around the use of AI technologies. Therefore, the use of Generative AI during
        learning exercises may limit the uptake of relevant knowledge and hinder the development of necessary skills.</p>

    <p>We also want to bring to your attention information on <strong>the use of Generative AI in the assessments</strong>. The assessments are
        expected to contain your original work. All summative submissions will be checked for the presence of AI-generated
        text and code. Cases of misconduct can be dealt with at School or College level depending on seriousness, and penalties may apply. You can
        find more information about University of Edinburgh Academic Misconduct Procedures <a
                href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/academicmisconductprocedures.pdf">here</a>. Further guidance on academic
        misconduct (including plagiarism) and how to avoid it can be found <a
                href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/staff/discipline/academic-misconduct">here</a>.

        Therefore, ensure your work does not flag as misconduct, when AI tools are used to assist you during the
        assessment preparation, you MUST DECLARE it by stating:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> What tool has been used (e.g., University-licenced ELM or ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI)</li>
        <li> What was the exact prompt</li>
        <li> Link to the output (&lsquo;link to chat&rsquo; for ChatGpT or a compilation of outputs as an appendix)</li>
        <li> What modifications have been done to the generated output before it was incorporated into the submitted work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We recommend using the University-licenced <a href="https://elm.edina.ac.uk/elm/elm">ELM</a> since it does not share your data.</p>
